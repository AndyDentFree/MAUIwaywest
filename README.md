Experimenting with MAUI with a distinctly iOS trend

I lost interest in continuing cross-platform work in MAUI due to:

- apparent state of it in late 2024
- reliance on Catalyst for Mac desktop
- not needing MAUI for desktop Windows dev as WPF is re-blessed
- a growing suspicion the _favoured path_ inside Microsoft is to use Blazor Hybrid

[From Build 2024](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/dotnet-build-2024-announcements/#multi-platform-development-with-.net)

>In .NET 8, we focused on enhancing performance & quality, supporting our ecosystem, improving the developer experience, and ensuring building Hybrid apps with .NET MAUI and Blazor were top notch. 

I am currently investigating Compose Multi-Platform over in [kotlyrical](https://github.com/AndyDentFree/kotlyrical) and finding Kotlin a lot closer to Swift than C#.

Also, of course, continuing my use of native Apple tech with SwiftUI in [swiftgooey](https://github.com/AndyDentFree/swiftgooey).
